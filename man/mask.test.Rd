\title{Testing the mask object for a first calls model.}
\usage{
mask.test(fit = NULL, mask, traps, pars, cutoff, lower.cutoff,
  surface = FALSE, col = c("black", "blue", "red"), pincol = "red", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A fitted model from \link{admbsecr}.}

\item{mask}{A matrix with two columns. Each row provides Cartesian
coordinates for the location of a mask point. The function
\code{\link{create.mask}} will return a suitable object.}

\item{traps}{A matrix with two columns. Each row provides Cartesian
coordinates for the location of a trap (or detector). Note that the ordering of the matrix should be the order of the trap IDs (as in \code{capt}).}

\item{pars}{A named list. Component names are parameter names, and
components are values of parameters at which the mask is to be
tested. Parameters must include \code{b0.ss}, \code{b1.ss}, and
\code{sigma.ss}; see \link{admbsecr} for further details.}

\item{cutoff}{The upper cutoff value; see \code{admbsecr} for
further details.}

\item{lower.cutoff}{The lower cutoff value; see \code{admbsecr} for
further details.}

\item{surface}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} a 3D detection surface is
plotted over the mask point locations.}

\item{col}{Colours of points. Three colours are required if
\code{surface} is \code{FALSE}; otherwise, just one is
required.}

\item{pincol}{Colour of pins when \code{surface} is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to \link{plot}.}

Creates a diagnostic plot that can be used to test the adequacy of
a mask for a first calls model.
